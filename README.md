This project attempts to replicate the analysis in the 2002 paper, "[Dictatorial Peace?](http://www.jstor.org/stable/3117807)", using updated data for the final assignment in my spring 2022 course, Authoritarianism, taught by Professor Lisa Anderson.  The original paper attempts to use the regime types of a pair of countries (a.k.a. a dyad) to explain the likelihood the dyad will engage in a militarized interstate dispute (MID) during a given year.  In order to replicate the findings, I create a new directed dyad-year dataset, drawing from updated versions of the same data used in the original paper, which include the following:

1. Geddes
2. Polity 5
3. Correlates of War

After creating the data, I perform basic analysis to replicate the original findings of the paper.  While the control coefficients are largely similar to the findings in the original paper, the main explanatory coefficients on regime types vary in magnitude and direction.  As some of the data processing is not explicitly stated in the original paper, the preparation of data diverges slightly, especially regarding the measure for relative economic development in a given year.  This may affect the comparability of the results, and should be reviewed in the future.

The data for the project is provided publicly in this github repository for validation purporses and in the name of transparency and reproducability.
